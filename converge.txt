Step-by-Step Instructions
High-Level Steps
Plan the App Architecture:

Decide on a client-server model or a serverless design.
Define data flow for fetching and caching news articles.
Plan for scalability and offline support.
Obtain Data Sources:

Access APIs or RSS feeds for the chosen platforms.
Ensure compliance with terms of use for each news source.
Develop Backend:

Create a RESTful API to fetch, process, and deliver news data.
Add caching (e.g., Redis) for quick access to frequently updated data.
Implement user account management if required (OAuth, Firebase Auth).
Develop Frontend:

Design a responsive UI for all devices.
Integrate data fetched from the backend.
Testing:

Perform unit, integration, and UI testing.
Test on multiple devices and screen sizes.
Deployment:

Deploy the backend and database.
Publish the app on Google Play and Apple App Store.
Low-Level Steps
Backend Development
Setup Environment:

Initialize your project using a backend framework.
Install required dependencies (e.g., express, requests).
Implement Data Fetching:

Write scripts to fetch news via RSS or APIs.
Normalize and store data in the database.
Build RESTful API:

Create endpoints for fetching news, categories, and user data.
Implement rate-limiting and authentication.
Optimize Backend:

Enable caching for frequently accessed news.
Use pagination for handling large datasets.
Frontend Development
Setup Development Environment:

Initialize your app project using your chosen frontend framework.
Install dependencies (e.g., flutter packages or npm install).
Build the UI:

Design screens for the Home page, News details, Categories, Bookmarks, and Settings.
Add animations for smooth transitions.
Integrate Backend:

Fetch data from API endpoints.
Handle error states and loading indicators.
Add Features:

Enable push notifications for breaking news.
Implement a dark mode.
UI/UX Suggestions
User Interface (UI)
Color Palette:

Use vibrant colors like blue, orange, and white for light mode.
